  # This option defines the first version of NixOS you have installed on this

  # Most users should NEVER change this value after the initial install, for
  # any reason, even if you've upgraded your system to a new NixOS release.
  #
  # This value does NOT affect the Nixpkgs version your packages and OS are
  # pulled from, so changing it will NOT upgrade your system.
  #
  # This value being lower than the current NixOS release does NOT mean your
  # system is out of date, out of support, or vulnerable.
  #
  # Do NOT change this value unless you have manually inspected all the changes
  # it would make to your configuration, and migrated your data accordingly.
